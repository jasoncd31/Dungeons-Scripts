# Dungeons Scripts
I love Dungeons & Dragaons, and I love Python. I've been writing some scripts to help me run my games, and I thought I'd share them with the world.

These scripts are not only a way to help me run my games, but also use Github Copilot. Many scripts are written using the suggestions from Github Copilot, including this README. These scripts are by no mean perfect for everyone. I will continue to tinker with them and improve them after suggestions and sessions.

Thanks for checking out my scripts!
